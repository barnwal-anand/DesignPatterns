Strategy Pattern:
In simpler terms, the Strategy Design Pattern provides a way to extract the behavior of an object into separate classes that can be swapped in and out at runtime. This enables the object to be more flexible and reusable, as different strategies can be easily added or modified without changing the object's core code.
